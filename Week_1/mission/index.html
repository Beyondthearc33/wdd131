        <h1>MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
        <h3>BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY-IDAHO</h3>
        <p>Brigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of
            Latter-day Saints. Its mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the
            Church, and their communities.

            The university does this by:
            Building testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and fostering its principles in a wholesome
            academic, cultural, and social environment. 
            
            Providing a high-quality education that prepares students of
            diverse interests and abilities for lifelong learning and employment. 
            
            Serving as many students as possible
            within resource constraints. 
            
            Delivering education that is affordable for students and the Church.</p>
